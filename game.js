// includes:
//   2 Player instances (human, computer)
//   A way to keep track of the data for the game board
//   A way to keep track of the selected game type
//   A way to detect when a game is a draw (no one has won)
      //I beleive this could also be a big conditional that determines who wins and loses.
//   A way to reset the Gameâ€™s board to begin a new game


//if statements for the rules of the game

//functionality to decide who the win

//the thing that the computer selects goes up against the randomized computer selection (reference romcom project)


//if game is selected - 1 set of rules

//if harder game is selected - 1 other set of rules


//Game logic:
//human wins if
