## Abstract  
This is an application that allows users to play *two* versions of a rock-paper-scissors type game against the computer. Users can select between the *basic* **Bear-Bee-Bowling Ball** version of the game or the *beast-mode* **Bear-Bee-Bowling Ball-Bike-Brunch** version.
After selecting their preferred version of the game, users will then select a *buddy* which will immediately go head-to-head against the computer's *buddy*. A tie or winner is declared and one point is awarded per win. Play one game, play one million!   

## Project Specs  
1. When the application is first loaded, the score is 0-0. The *Human* (user) stats are displayed on the left side of the screen while the *Computer* stats are on the right.
